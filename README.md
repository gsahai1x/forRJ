1. Traffic EDA - This file is for analysis and runs exploratory data analysis and performs feature engineering. 
2. train - trains the processed data using multiple regressors
3. predict - takes a input file which should have the data in the same format as traffic.csv, and predicts the traffic volume based on the given data. 
4. *** Note - In this case, I assume that the file will also have traffic volume, since this is a test and one would like to test with known data. ***
